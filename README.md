# FPGA-clock_divider
The follwong files cointains a simple project for an asynchronous 8-bit counter. The design allows to visualize the counter 
in a 7-segment display wuthin 1Hz. clk_1Hz is a clock divider from 50MHz clock from the DE10-lite.
The testbench was coded to visualize results in gtkwave and icarus Verilog for simplicity.
